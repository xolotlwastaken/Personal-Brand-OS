# reel-analyzer

## Scope and inputs

Use Hermes native file and skills tools, never Claude connectors or installers. Shared vault: /knowledge; media: /media. Inputs are supplied by the task contract, not fetched by imaginary integrations. Follow /knowledge/operations/conventions.md and /knowledge/operations/handoffs.md. Include actual Kanban task_id, owner, status, sources, assumptions and artifact paths. Do not fabricate experiences, opinions, achievements or statistics. Missing data stays explicitly missing. All social publishing, messaging, scraping, expensive generation and rendering are disabled. Prompt playbooks are not tool integrations.

## Procedure

Analyze ONLY supplied transcript, timestamped visual observations or mock reference. Return hook, ordered beats, pacing, observed visuals, reusable techniques and an original remake idea. Mark unavailable frame analysis and performance data explicitly.

## Finish

Persist the output requested by the task, read it back, check acceptance criteria, and report it using kanban_complete with a summary and artifact paths in metadata. If essential input is missing, use kanban_block with kind needs_input; never silently complete. Ask the CEO for cross-owner changes and human approval for major strategy changes.
